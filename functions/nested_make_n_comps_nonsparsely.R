  Sometimes we will not use results of certain kin-comps. 
  EG POP when caught in same year (to avoid unweaned offspring being sampled near mother); 
  HSP when birth-gap is long enuf that GGP becomes likely. 
  These were _not_ necessarily filtered out when MOPs and HSPs were made earlier.
  
  ALSO this version of make_n_comps definitely applies the nonsparsity patches.
  
  In theory, it should first remove all prior-to-last-capture SelfP members from all MOP and XmHSP comps, and adjust sample sizes for MOPs & XmHSPs accordingly. However, that's already been done in Eiren's two-part dataset structure. If rewriting from scratch, I would do things differently, starting from one file that includes ALL samples, but that's more effort and waaaay too much work for now.
  
  Next, it removes all O's in MOPs from XmHSP comparisons.
  
  Next, it counts triads etc in SelfPs and XmHSPs, removes the superfluous pairs, and adjusts overall sample sizes (somewhat crudely) for those two types of comparison to bring the expected total into line with the superfluity-reduced outcomes.
