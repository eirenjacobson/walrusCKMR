"get_usable_SS" <-
function( m_SYEL, Devstage_A){
  r"--{
  Extract usable SS for different types of comp, eg female-only, live, seg-agged, etc. Starts from full array of samps by [Sex, Year, E(stimated age), Lethality]. Returns a list suitable for passing to make_n_comps()
  
  Even this isn't the full story, coz make_n_comps() will omit certain comparisons (ie will zero the number of comps in certain categories) on the basis that those results would not be useful (eg mother & child sampled in same year).

  For most design calcs this is enough, but for a few things (eg effects of not using CK) you might want to tweak some SSes before make_n_comps (or afterwards).
