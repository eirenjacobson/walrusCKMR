\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report describes the first stage of a project to develop a Close-Kin
 Mark-Recapture (CKMR) model suitable for Pacific walrus (
\shape italic
Odobenus rosmarus divergens
\shape default
) samples from a non-lethal biopsy sampling program in the Chukchi Sea;
 lethal samples from hunters may be incorporated at a later date.
 Similar samples are also available from 2013–2017 cruises, and the current
 incarnation of the sampling program runs from 2023 thru 2027; it was originally
 envisaged as a genetic individual mark-recapture (IMR) project just for
 individuals, but the advent of CKMR raised the possibility of getting much
 more value-for-money by also using the samples for close-kin mark-recapture.
 Roughly, the gain is that each new sample not only "tags" a walrus for
 future recapture, but also its parents, its offspring (which may not yet
 be born), and its half-siblings.
 This multiplies the effective sample size considerably, and also gives
 somewhat different and complementary information about demographics compared
 to IMR.
 The only and very minor downside is that higher-quality genotyping is required
 for finding close-kin, but the additional cost is worth it, especially
 if it ultimately leads to reduced sample-size requirements.
 A further technical development, in about the same time frame as CKMR,
 has been the possibility of epigenetic ageing.
 Age data is immensely powerful for IMR as well as CKMR.
 The main novelty is to devise a computational framework for "ICKMR" that
 can handle both CKMR and IMR at once, including age information: this is
 new.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model we develop can be used while sampling is ongoing to anticipate
 what precision of various quantities-of-interest (such as adult abundance)
 is likely to be obtained by 2027 or before; to investigate the pros and
 cons of varying the way sampling is done; to design diagnostics that could
 be used to test for departures from baseline model assumptions (e.g., changing
 trends in abundance) and, of course, to fit the actual genetic data, once
 it arrives.
 We have also developed, independently, an individual-based simulation that
 can be used to test our estimation model.
 The work should result in a publication, as well as usable software; at
 this stage, we are producing a report and a preliminary version of the
 software, plus various results on likely precision and speculation on future
 options.

\begin_layout Subsection
Biology and sampling from the viewpoint of CKMR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pacific walrus have a fairly typical "CKMR ideal mammal" life history, at
 least in terms of females: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
long-lived post-maturity;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
small litter size (at most 1 calf per "litter");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
unlikely to re-mate with the same partner (thus few full sibling or full
 thiatic pairs; FSPs or FTPs);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no obvious reason to expect some females to be much better breeders than
 others;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
highly mobile, so population is "well-mixed" from a sampling point-of-view
 (but see later), and with no genetic substructure expected;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
age estimates are expected for all samples; i.e., "DNAge" (epigenetic estimates)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Probably no need for calves, which are obvious.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these are good news for the simplicity of CKMR modelling and the
 reliability of estimates.
 However, a CKMR model also has to take into account the details of how
 samples are obtained, and this does raise a few 
\emph on
potential
\emph default
 complications for walrus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sampling is (mostly) non-lethal;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
male adults inaccessible, and likely to have substantial persistent individual
 variability in breeding success;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
"skippy" breeding cycle, with at most one calf every other year;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
incorporation of self-recaptures (IMR) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[ageing error from DNAge] (see below)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[partial site fidelity to Russian or to American waters] (see below)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unavailability of male adult samples (at least in large enough numbers
 to be useful) basically means that we cannot model males at all, and so
 we simply do not include paternal half-sibling pairs (HSPs) in the model
 (even though there will be plenty in the dataset).
 The problem is that father-offspring pairs (FOPs) will not be available,
 and the demographics of paternal-half-sibling pairs (pHSPs) are determined
 not by overall adult male abundance and survival, but rather only by those
 males who persistently manage to breed.
 Substantial persistent heterogeneity in male breeding success is to be
 expected given the "lekking" behaviour of walrus, and there is no way just
 to distinguish from pHSPs alone between fewer male adults with lower variabilit
y, versus more adults with a small set of "supermales".
 Male adult survival estimates would be confounded by the rate at which
 hitherto-successful breeders "lose their mojo" and become invisible to
 the pHSP dataset.
 Further, male calves and juveniles are not useful in walrus IMR, because
 male juveniles undergo "permanent emigration" away from the summer sampling
 grounds, at whatever age they opt to stay south of the Bering Strait.
 Thus, like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Beatty2022walrusMR"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we only try to model female dynamics.
 That said, it is perfectly reasonable to use male juveniles (and possibly
 calves; see Discussion) as potential 
\emph on
offspring
\emph default
 whose mothers might be recaptured.
 This gives an ICKMR models (or its POP component) access to a rather larger
 set of samples than IMR alone can use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start of this project, we expected that the last two square-bracketed
 points would be important, and in fact developed the model equations and
 code with them in mind.
 However, as discussed below, we now do not expect either of them to matter
 much, so they have been switched off for design purposes.
 Those two phenomena account for a sizeable fraction of the model code.
 The spatial aspect in particular entails copious extra maths and has subtly
 unpleasant interactions with breeding-cycle mechanics; "unweaned" offspring
 may accompany their mother for several years whereas weaned ones go their
 own way, all of which requires modeling.
 It is with great relief that we have discarded those complications, at
 least for now! If the real data eventually suggest these need attention—
 which at present seems unlikely— they could (with appreciable effort) be
 switched on again.
 Alternatively, if they are definitively not important, the code could be
 simplified quite a lot, which is desirable long-term for clarity and ease
 of maintenance.
 For this report, we have used the full code but with zero age error and
 only one region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Epigenetic age ("DNAge")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individual age data, or an informative surrogate (e.g., length for some fish)
 is essential for CKMR.
 If age "data" is sufficiently bad, it can make CKMR results almost uninterpreta
ble, even with large numbers of kin-pairs (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "bradford2018ckmr-gns"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for an unfortunate example).
 All CK probabilities are basically conditioned on year-of-birth of a potential
 offspring or half-sibling, which is deduced from measured age and sampling
 date.
 Hence, if age is uncertain, then so is birth-year, and the probabilities
 need to be combined using weighted sums and awkward prior probabilities
 to make them conditional on 
\emph on
measured
\emph default
 age rather than true age.
 While generally possible, this is a lot of modeling work and does tend
 to reduce the overall information content of a CKMR dataset, leading to
 less-precise estimates than would result from precisely-aged datasets.
 In extreme cases such as that cited above, the reduction in information
 is drastic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Epigenetic age estimation offers a convenient way to get age estimates even
 from non-lethal sampling that are at least useful.
 One of us (MVB) has been involved in DNAge

\end_inset

 projects for many years, through work at CSIRO.
 The potential for use in fisheries and wildlife assessment has always been
 clear, but the technology, and the analytical machinery, have improved
 massively in recent years.
 Before this project began, DNAge results were typically quite impressive
 in the aggregate (i.e., in terms of correlation with known-age samples) although,
 at an individual level, imprecision was often non-ignorably high.
 Whilst this state of affairs was still a 
\emph on
huge
\emph default
 advance on anything previously available, especially for live-sampled species,
 it still required a lot of extra work within CKMR (and other) models to
 allow for the imprecision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But matters seem to have improved again.
 Since this project began, in-prep results at CSIRO for several tuna species
 have shown extremely
\emph on
 
\emph default
good agreement between DNAge and otolith age (Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dnage"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The results are good enough that ageing error can effectively be ignored
 in CKMR models for those tuna species, at least for design purposes, because
 the loss of precision through ageing error is now negligible.
 The main reason for the improvement is a change in the statistical machinery
 of analysis.
 Although walrus and tuna are clearly different animals, the fact that the
 improvement (over previous results on tuna) is 
\emph on
methodological
\emph default
 rather than purely data-driven, gives reasonable hope that DNAges can be
 treated as exact for walrus.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our walrus model code was mostly written in the expectation that ageing
 error would have to be accounted for, so it is actually a lot longer and
 more confusing than if we re-wrote it from scratch expecting no ageing
 error.
 The results we show here are when the "ageing error parameter" is set to
 zero.
 If the ongoing walrus ageing project does still end up with substantial
 ageing error, at least the model could be re-expanded with 
\emph on
relatively
\emph default
 little pain (a few more recent parts, e.g., nursing status, are written without
 any allowance for ageing error).
 If not, the model might be re-written to exclude ageing error altogether,
 for simplicity and ease of maintenance.
 But there is no point in crossing either of those bridges ahead of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spatial fidelity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summer, Pacific walrus use both the "eastern" (USA) and "western" (Russian)
 parts of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.
 For the foreseeable future, sampling will only occur in the former.
 This means that, in any given year, some animals will simply be unavailable
 for sampling.
 One concern about the project in general, has been whether such "spatial
 matters" will lead to bias.
 This has been a question for a number of CK projects, as well as for IMR,
 of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that "spatial availability" only matters to CKMR/IMR
 if it is 
\emph on
persistent
\emph default
 and/or 
\emph on
heritable
\emph default
 at the individual level.
 In any IMR study, some animals will be unavailable, for whatever reason,
 during the initial marking phase, and some will be unavailable during the
 recapture phase.
 The key assumption required by IMR to avoid bias, is that those two availabilit
ies are 
\emph on
independent
\emph default
, conditional on whatever sample covariates are used in the model.
 If not, the analysis will be subject to the infamous curse of "unmodeled
 heterogeneity in capture probability", leading to bias.
 Sometimes appropriate conditioning covariates can be added to an IMR model
 to remedy that, sometimes not.
 But in any case, if availability is independent between occasions, there
 should be no bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on previous spatial CKMR planning exercises, we originally expected
 to implement a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Russian\SpecialChar breakableslash
American preference.
 Each adult's preference might change from year to year, but would likely
 be the same as last years; and an offspring would do whatever its mother
 did spatially until it "weaned".
 However, examination of satellite-tag data during the project contra-indicated
 such behaviour, at least as a commonplace phenomenon.
 Most animals in fact drifted between Russian and American waters 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 the course of a single season, so there seems no way they could exhibit
 a consistent preference 
\emph on
across
\emph default
 seasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turned out that the spatial HMM entailed a lot of work (though it can
 be done, at least in principle); whether it could be fitted reliably just
 from CKMR/IMR data would depend on how extensive the early Russian sampling
 was.
 But since the satellite-tag data suggest it is probably not applicable,
 it seems best to put it aside for now, assume a simpler model applies where
 all (female) walrus are equally likely to get sampled (conditional on age)
 per year, and resurrect any persistent spatial model only if there is clear
 evidence down the track, e.g., from the CKMR data themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General framework of CKMR and ICKMR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We follow the highly tractable approach to CKMR described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Bravington2016CKMR"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The full likelihood of "who is related to who and how" is 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
tractable, but we can reduce the data to a very large number of pairwise
 comparisons of genotypes, potentially between every sample and all other
 samples, in which each outcome is either "yes these two are a kin-pair
 of specified type (e.g., parent-offspring pair; POP)" or "no they are not".
 Comparisons are made separately for POPs, for HSPs (second-order kin),
 and for any other useful types of kin; the practical limit at present is
 that no kinship more remote than second-order can be reliably detected.
 The probability of each comparison yielding a "yes" depends both on demographic
 parameters, such as those related to abundance—the more "choices" an individual
 has for its mother, the lower the probability that any given female will
 turn out to be that mother—and also on the covariates of the individual
 samples, such as year of collection and age—an individual cannot possibly
 be the offspring of another individual that died before the first one was
 born.
 Each comparison is a Bernoulli (0/1) random event, and the overall log-likeliho
od is formed by adding up the log-likelihoods of every comparison, of which
 there can be literally billions in some projects (the number is proprotional
 to the square of the sample size).
 Crucially, for "large" populations (which certainly covers adult abundances
 of 100,000 and more), the great majority of samples will have no close-kin
 among the other samples, and all comparisons are effectively independent
 statistically, in that there is on average minimal statistical power to
 predict the outcome of the next comparison even based on knowing the outcomes
 of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to incorporate IMR data into the same framework, treating
 a self-recapture as just another kin-type that can be tested for genetically:
 a "SP" (self-pair) rather than a POP, HSP, or FSP.
 All that is needed, is to develop the appropriate probability formulae.
 These are in some sense simpler than for CKMR itself but, as we shall see,
 there are some subtleties about how best to formulate the population dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The art of CKMR consists largely in devising probability formulae for the
 different kinships, appropriate to the biology and sampling process being
 considered, and conditional on covariates that can actually be measured
 for the two samples.
 It is usually easiest to start by working out the formulae for ideal measuremen
ts, i.e., if we knew everything we would like to about the two samples (age,
 sex, etc).
 Sometimes it is not possible to perfectly measure everything, e.g., if age
 data is imprecise
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A common example is for fish, where only length measurements may be available
 for some or all samples— although length is an important CKMR covariate
 in its own right for fish.
 But that is another story.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In such cases, the kinship probability formulae need to be "blurred", by
 summing probabilistically over the possible values that the true covariates
 might have been, given the imperfect measurements that were made of them.
 Happily, it seems as though that might not be necessary for walrus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the appropriately-blurred probabilities have been calculated for all
 possible categories (kinships, covariates) of comparison, the log-likelihood
 is readily calculated from the actual comparison outcomes.
 All comparisons with alike kinship-target and covariates can be grouped,
 to yield a single Binomial likelihood term, which can be very well approximated
 by a Poisson probability since the per-comparison chance of "success" is
 invariably very small (roughly reciprocal to adult abundance).
 The demographic parameters for CKMR or ICKMR can be estimated by maximum
 likelihood or Bayesian methods.

The genetic side of CKMR is a whole field in itself, but suffice to say
 here that, if it is done properly with modern techniques and good-quality
 samples, kin-finding is reliable and there is no need to consider kinship
 uncertainty in the design or the estimation
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Actually, the need to avoid false-positive kin-pairs does mean that some
 proportion of true HSPs will fail to be recognized as ssi[[uch.
 This proportion, which can be estimated externally to the CKMR model itself
 once the data arrive, has typically been 10-20%; see e.g.
 Supplement 2 of

 for details (and there is now code in the R package 
\family typewriter
kinference
\family default
 which automates some of the steps).
 It does lead to a reduction in information content compared to a "naive"
 assumption that all HSPs will be found.
 This should definitely be built in when analysing real data (it is simple
 to do so), and arguably should be in design as well, assuming say a 15%
 false-negative rate on HSPs.
 We have sometimes done so for other species' designs..
 However, especially given MOP and SP data as well, the reduction is not
 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 large, and we anticipate anyway that ongoing developments in kin-finding,
 making use of high-quality genome assemblies, will eliminate the false-negative
 loss.
 We have deliberately gone with the "naive" assumption here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is also worth noting that, for HSPs, it is simple to determine genetically
 whether the link is maternal (i.e., shared mother) or paternal, via mtDNA
 checks
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Haplotypic diversity in large populations is high enough that any risk of
 sharing a haplotype by chance (and thus misclassifying a paternal HSP as
 maternal) is negligible.
 For very small populations, that may not be true.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The two types, mHSP and pHSP, can have very different demographics and
 probabilities of occurence, because male and female reproductive behaviour
 can be completely different (and is for walrus), so the distinction is
 vital.

\begin_layout Standard
Sampling design is crucial for CKMR, because if too few samples are collected,
 or the samples are the wrong "type" (e.g., missing crucial age classes),
 or the covariates are not measured well enough, there will be too few useful
 kin-pairs to make any useful inference, notwithstanding a lot of effort
 and expense in collection, genotyping, etc.
 The quadratic relationship between sample size and expected kin-pairs (since
 the number of comparisons is quadratic in sample size) is often beneficial
 in CKMR— precision improvement per dollar spent increases as a sampling
 programme goes on— but has the flipside that too few samples means 
\emph on
far
\emph default
 too few kinpairs.
 Sadly, in our experience, CKMR projects are sometimes started as a rather
 ad hoc "experiment" on a shoestring budget with inadequate design; such
 projects do not usually end well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of walrus, there is already an effective IMR program in place,
 so the design process is not as critical as for most other species.
 Nevertheless, it is very useful to go through a design exercise because:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it enforces development of an appropriate CKMR model well before the real
 data and its complications arrive;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it gives realistic heads-up on what might be achieved from the study, important
 for longer-term planning;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it allows exploration of ways that the sampling program might be modified:
 would it yield better information for similar cost? etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the independent-comparison Poisson-like-probability framework
 of CKMR, it turns out to be remarkably easy to predict precision of anything-of
-interest, 
\emph on
without
\emph default
 needing to do repeat simulations or even fit a CKMR model to simulated
 data.
 The basic point is that every comparison between two specific samples is
 practically statistically independent of the others, so as well as adding
 one term to the log-likelihood, it also adds one term (a matrix) to the
 second derivative

\end_layout

\end_inset

 of that log-likelihood.
 It turns out that the expected value of that matrix (the per-comparison
 Fisher Information) can be computed very easily (see below).
 The overall Hessian is formed by summing all those per-comparison matrices,
 so the other requirement is of course to know how many comparisons of each
 type there will be.
 Once the expected Hessian is calculated, it can be inverted as usual to
 give the (expected) covariance matrix of the parameters, and from there
 standard errors can be calculated for any quantity-of-interest 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 (i.e., something that depends on the estimatable parameters) by applying
 the ubiquitous "delta method": 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}\left[f\left(\theta\right)|y\right]\approx f'\left(\hat{\theta}\left(y\right)\right)\mathbb{V}\left[\theta|y\right]f'\left(\hat{\theta}\left(y\right)\right)^{\top}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To show the single-comparison Hessian calculation in more detail, suppose
 we are considering a MOP comparison between potential-offspring 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and potential-parent 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, with covariates 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 respectively (so one component of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 is that 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is female, otherwise the probability is of course 0).
 The demographic parameters are 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (a vector, indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 below).
 Let the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{ij}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 denote the outcome, taking value 1 if 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 turns out to be 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's mother, and 0 if not; and let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}\left(\theta\right)\triangleq\mathbb{P}\left[Y_{ij}=1|z_{i}z_{j}\theta\right]$
\end_inset

 be the probability of "success", to be calculated from some application-specifi
c formula as described in detail later on.
 Although 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is strictly speaking Bernoulli distributed, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 is so low (on the order of the reciprocal of population size) that a Poisson
 distribution with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 is an excellent approximation.
 Omitting all subscripts etc where reasonably possible, the log-likelihood
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{\text{MOP}ij}$
\end_inset

 for the comparison is therefore
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\Lambda=-p+Y\log p-\log Y!\label{eq:poi-app}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From standard statistical theory for Fisher Information, we know that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\text{FI}\triangleq-\mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\left.\frac{d^{2}\Lambda\left(Y;\theta\right)}{d\theta^{2}}\right\vert _{\theta_{0}}\right]=\mathbb{E}_{Y}\left[\left.\frac{d\Lambda\left(Y;\theta\right)}{d\theta}\frac{d\Lambda\left(Y;\theta\right)}{d\theta}^{\top}\right\vert _{\theta_{0}}\right]\label{eq:hess-jac-sqr}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

so it suffices to consider the first derivative of (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:poi-app"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda'_{k}\triangleq d\Lambda/d\theta_{k}$
\end_inset

 etc, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\Lambda'_{k}=-p_{k}'+\frac{Y}{p}p_{k}'=\frac{p'_{k}}{p}\left(Y-p\right)\nonumber \\
\implies\Lambda'_{k}\Lambda'_{\ell}=\frac{p'_{k}p'_{\ell}}{p^{2}}\left(Y-p\right)^{2}\nonumber \\
\implies\mathbb{E}\left[\Lambda'_{k}\Lambda'_{\ell}\right]=\frac{p'_{k}p'_{\ell}}{p^{2}}\mathbb{E}\left[\left(Y-p\right)^{2}\right]\nonumber \\
=\frac{p'_{k}p'_{\ell}}{p^{2}}\mathbb{V}\left[Y\right]=\frac{p'_{k}p'_{\ell}}{p}\label{eq:ELLT}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}\left[Y\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[Y\right]=p$
\end_inset

 for a Poisson distribution.
 A slight computational simplification comes from noting that, for any function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, we have by the chain rule that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\frac{d\sqrt{f\left(x\right)}}{dx}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{f\left(x\right)}}f'\left(x\right)\label{eq:dsqrtf}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{E}\left[\Lambda'_{k}\Lambda'_{\ell}\right]=\frac{p'_{k}p'_{\ell}}{p}=4\left(\frac{p'_{k}}{2\sqrt{p}}\right)\left(\frac{p'_{\ell}}{2\sqrt{p}}\right)=4\frac{d\sqrt{p}}{d\theta_{k}}\frac{d\sqrt{p}}{d\theta_{\ell}}\label{eq:sqrt-trick}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

which avoids having to worry about 0/0 and streamlines some of the computation.
 The overall Fisher Information for the entire dataset is then formed by
 summing the per-comparison FI matrices.
 Note that all this theory is hinted at in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

In practice, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 will involve several lines of code, and the only practical, reliable way
 to compute things like 
\begin_inset Formula $d\sqrt{p}/d\theta_{k}$
\end_inset

 is by Automatic Differentiation (for which the code needs to be written
 in TMB or some other special-purpose framework) or by numerical differentiation.
 The latter turns out to be perfectly adequate for design calculations,
 although for actually fitting to data (where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\Lambda\left(y\right)/d\theta$
\end_inset

 itself is required for observed values 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, not the expected outer-product) Automatic Differentiation is much more
 reliable.
\end_layout

 there will be.
 The details are application-specific and often a bit fiddly, but conceptually
 simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Code and coding conventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marshalling of data for design or real-data analysis can only reasonably
 be done in R nowadays.
 When it comes to the "core" CKMR code for probabilities and log-likelihoods
 and so on, there are perhaps two options: R again, or TMB (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Kristensen16TMB"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), which is driven by R wrappers.
 For any reasonably complex CKMR model, a TMB version is essential for fitting
 to 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 data for speed and for the ability to estimate random effect variances
 (something which is probably not relevant for walrus).
 However, for CKMR design and (most) testing, speed is usually not important
 because there are mathematical shortcuts which make the process very quick.
 (This is only true for CKMR— most general design situations entail much
 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 computing than is required for working with a real dataset).
 For CKMR design, it suffices to write purely in R, which is generally less
 painful than TMB, especially for debugging.
 All the code for this project has been written in R, although we have started
 and will finish producing a TMB-ported version before publication.
 The R code so far, both for estimation and for simulation, is available
 from 
\family typewriter
https://github.com/waldez
\family default
 (currently private; individual access can be added).
 The site also contains simulated dataset(s), and various notes on installation
 and usage.
 In due course, we will add TMB code, as discussed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R is a "broad church" as languages go, with many different ways to code
 the same thing.
 However, there are a few features which we have found indispensable for
 writing tolerably efficient and succinct CKMR code.
 The main one is the 
\family typewriter
offarray
\family default
 package, which allows arrays (and matrices and vectors) to be indexed starting
 at arbitrary values, not just at 1.
 This is enormously convenient when one wants population dynamics to start
 in year 2000, say, and when indices of probabilities need to work for negative
 (i.e., past) time as well as for future time.
 The package is well documented, and some notes on its use (from previous
 CKMR courses) are on the website.
 For the code snippets that appear in this report, the key function to understan
d is 
\family typewriter
autoloop
\family default
, which fills in an entire array by looping over named ranges, such as 
\family typewriter
PDYEARS
\family default
 for all years covered by the population dynamics model (in this case 
\family typewriter
2000:2028
\family default
, in R values) and 
\family typewriter
SELF1AGES
\family default
 for the relevant age-classes in IMR, and applying a formula for each combinatio
n.
 It is easier to use than to explain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Translating from R to TMB can be painful, but in fact things have gotten
 easier (at least for CKMR-like applications) since this project began,
 thanks to the TMBO extension to TMB ("TMBO" is actually an R package that
 replaces the standard "TMB" R package, which provides drivers for code
 written in the TMB language; the nomenclature is confusing).
 The TMBO extension allows arbitrary-offset arrays, just like 
\family typewriter
offarray
\family default
 in R itself, and the interchange of data between R and TMBO is pretty seamless;
 an array can be indexed with exactly the same indices in R and in TMB (which
 also avoids the error-prone 0-offset vs 1-offset distinction between "normal"
 R and TMB).
 Thus, once the R model details have been finalized, the final translation
 from R into the "standard language" TMB may be less painful than it would
 have been 12 months ago.
 It will be important to decide soon whether to translate the entire code
 including ageing error and\SpecialChar breakableslash
or spatial fidelity, or whether to convert a
 stripped-down version that will be easier to follow.

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that female adult walrus have constant survival over age and time,
 and that the total number of female adults is increasing or decreasing
 exponentially over the period covered by the population dynamics (2000–2027;
 the lower limit of 2000 is set because there were fairly drastic changes
 in the population prior to that).
 We also assume that the age composition is fairly stable over that period
 ("quasi-equilibrium" or "quasi-stable"), so that (at least amongst younger
 adults) it should follow a geometric distribution.
 The parameter of that distribution is determined by the simple relations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
N_{y+1,a+1}=N_{ya}\phi_{\text{ad}}\nonumber \\
N_{y+1,a}=e^{\text{RoI}}N_{y,a}\nonumber \\
\implies N_{y+1,,a+1}=N_{y+1,a}\times\phi_{\text{ad}}e^{-\text{RoI}}\label{eq:age-distro-slope}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{ad}}$
\end_inset

is female adult annual survival.
 From this, the adult numbers-at-age (and at year) can be inferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Juvenile females age 1–6 have a different survival rate, again assumed constant
 within (juvenile) ages and over time.
 We again assume that the juvenile age composition is stable over time,
 having settled down from whatever perturbations preceded the model years.
 Since the number of 7yo adults in any year can be determined as just described,
 the number of 6yo juveniles the previous year can be obtained by dividing
 by juvenile survival, and so on.
 Thus, the juvenile abundance and age composition can be inferred indirectly
 from the adult versions, 
\emph on
assuming
\emph default
 quasi-stability applies.
 There is no attempt to explicitly model "incoming juveniles" from calves
 the previous years; calves are not currently represented in our estimation
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a stable-age-composition between 2000–2027 is probably not valid for
 the entire range of adult ages—since older adults would have experienced
 long periods of increased mortality from hunting—it is perhaps a reasonable
 assumption for younger adults, and it is only younger adults that matter
 here because they indirectly determine the number of juveniles.
 A stable age composition for juveniles seems fairly reasonable, since "recruitm
ent variability" cannot be high for an animal with a litter size of 1, and
 it only requires a few years for the juvenile distribution to settle down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Age structure per se is not required for CKMR, and adult age structure is
 not required for IMR either, at least given the way we have formulated
 the latter (see later).
 All probabilities are conditional on measured ages, which "are what they
 are", and the model does not need to consider the sample age composition
 (see Discussion), i.e.
 not "why are they what they are?".
 However, our formulation of IMR does assume that sampling is unselective
 within juveniles, and also within adults (but not between the two), and
 the age composition enters indirectly because of the way that juvenile
 abundance is calculated.
 The full ramifications of opting for a stage-structured quasi-equilibrium
 model, which avoids having to model age composition but does entail an
 
\emph on
assumption
\emph default
 about selectivity, are not at all obvious, but the model seems to us fairly
 reasonable; it might be worth revisiting when large numbers of DNAge samples
 become available.
 At that point it would be possible to compare the actual age compositions
 with the predicted compositions assuming partly-unselective sampling and
 quasi-equilibrium.

 We allow

Females enter state 3 on reaching age 5, and cannot give birth until age
 7.
 Depending on the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{3}$
\end_inset

, this leads to a (fairly quick) ramping-up in effective fecundity (i.e.,
 probability of being in state 2) over the first few years of adult life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$

 We do not use any data on whether females were with\SpecialChar breakableslash

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 distribution of birth-gaps between mHSPs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The breeding-cycle model constitutes a (partly-)Hidden Markov Model, in
 that next year's state depends only on this year's.
 The transition matrix which embodies the description above can be used
 to calculate various useful commodities, via standard HMM manipulations.
 For example, the proportion of the population with calf (i.e., in state 2)
 at any time is 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\beta}_{2}$
\end_inset

, the second element of the eigenvector with largest eigenvalue.
 This eigenvector can readily be solved for, since the eigenvalue is known
 to be 1.
 Also, the probability that an animal with calf has returned to state 2
 after a gap of any specified number of years (required for HSP probabilities
 below) can be found by repeated matrix multiplication.
 The code has examples.

Suppose we are about to compare a potential-mother "Connie", sampled at
 age 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{c}$

\begin_inset Formula $y_{c}$
\end_inset

, to a potential-offspring "Jenny", sampled at age

 in year 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

, and therefore born in year 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}\triangleq y_{j}-a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 We specifically restrict attention to comparisons that satisfy the following
 criteria:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Connie is female (though "Jenny" need not be); only female adult dynamics
 are being modelled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}=y_{c}$
\end_inset

 because there is some possibility that Jenny and her mother are still physicall
y associated, so within a single year their chances of being sampled are
 positively correlated;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}\geqslant1$
\end_inset

 because calves are not being used in the current model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}\geqslant2000$
\end_inset

 because we are only modelling population dynamics post 2000; thus the model
 has no idea how many adults were alive in any year before that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, we do not try to calculate probabilities for the excluded
 cases; we set the number of comparisons for such cases to zero; and we
 also set the number of MOPs for such cases to zero.
 (It is still worth checking those comparisons genetically just for interest's
 sake, but the results, positive or negative, are not used in the model.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With those restrictions in mind, we can distinguish two cases: 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{c}<b_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{c}\geqslant b_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 In the former, Connie still has to survive several years in order to be
 Jenny's mother (note that Connie may be immature when sampled, but mature
 by the time of Jenny's birth).
 The MOP probability is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[K_{cj}=\text{MOP}|a_{c},y_{c},b_{j},\text{nonlethal}_{c}\right]=\nonumber \\
\frac{\text{Connie's Expected Reproductive Output in \ensuremath{b_{j}}|Connie alive and age \ensuremath{a_{c}} in \ensuremath{y_{c}}}}{\text{Total Reproductive Output (of females) in \ensuremath{b_{j}}}}\label{eq:MOP1}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can pick any unit-scale for ERO/TRO (units always cancel between the
 nominator and denominator in CKMR).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here it is convenient to choose "number of calves", so the TRO is 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\beta_{2}}N\left(b_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\beta_{2}}$
\end_inset

 is the proportion of females with calves at any one time (section

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a 
\emph on
very minor
\emph default
 approximation involved here; females start their breeding life in a non-pregnan
t state, and average fecundity over the first few years of adult life is
 
\emph on
slightly
\emph default
 below asymptotic fecundity.
 Thus the TRO "should" depend on the population's adult age composition.
 In practice, for walrus and many other mammals, the dominant reproductive
 output is from somewhat older animals (there are more of them) and the
 effect is negligible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two components to Connie's ERO: first, she has to survive; second,
 she has to be calving in 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\text{ERO}_{c}\left(b_{j}|y_{c},a_{c}\right)=\Phi\left(y_{c}-b_{j}a_{c}\right)\times\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Br}\left(\text{age}=a_{c}+\left(b_{j}-y_{c}\right)\right)=2\right]\label{eq:MOP-RO}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Br}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 is an individual's breeding state, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi\left(\Delta t,a\right)\triangleq\text{survival probability for \ensuremath{\Delta t} years starting from age \ensuremath{a}}$
\end_inset

, obtained by multiplying together the right number of annual juvenile and
 adult survival probabilities.
 The term on the right involves Connie's age at 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 (assuming she survives).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For convenience, define Fecundity via
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\text{fec}\left(a\right)\triangleq\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Br}\left(a\right)=2\right]}{\bar{\beta}_{2}},\label{eq:fec-def}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

so that immature animals have fecundity 0, and an average adult has fecundity
 1.
 (Fecundity at ages just after maturity may be slightly different.) Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[K_{cj}=\text{MOP}|a_{c},y_{c},b_{j},\text{nonlethal}_{c},y_{c}<b_{j}\right]=\nonumber \\
\frac{\Phi\left(y_{c}-b_{j},a_{c}\right)\times\text{fec}\left(a_{c}+\left(b_{j}-y_{c}\right)\right)}{N\left(b_{j}\right)}.\label{eq:MOP-future}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second case is if Connie is sampled after Jenny's birth.
 In that case, we know Connie was "alive" (or not born yet), so there is
 no survival term to worry about, but she may not have been mature.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{fec}\left(a\leqslant0\right)=0$
\end_inset

 (walruses cannot breed before birth) for convenience, we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[K_{cj}=\text{MOP}|a_{c},y_{c},b_{j},\text{nonlethal}_{c},b_{j}<y_{c}\right]=\nonumber \\
\frac{\text{fec}\left(a_{c}-\left(y_{c}-b_{j}\right)\right)}{N\left(b_{j}\right)}.\label{eq:MOP-past}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that Jenny's age at sampling does not appear (provided she is not a
 calf); it is only her date-of-birth that matters.
 However, if ageing error was appreciable (i.e., we measure approximate age
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

 instead), then it is usually necessary to consider both 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

, and sum over the possible 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 that Jenny 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 have been born in, with appropriate probability weights.
 The current code actually has provision for that, but the equations are
 basically just tedious and do not shed much light on the mechanics of CKMR
 itself, so we omit them here.

Computationally, these formulae need to be evaluated over all possible combinati
ons of 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j},y_{c},a_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 It is simplest to use an identical formula for all cases, with extra 0/1
 multiplicative terms to "switch off" comparisons that have zero probability,
 and with artificial clipping of array indices to avoid Out-Of-Bounds access.
 For example, it is simplest 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 to include a survival term even when 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{c}>b_{j}$
\end_inset

, but simply ensure that it returns the value 1 in such cases.
 It is also best to pre-calculate as many quantities as possible, e.g., the
 cumulative survival probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left(\Delta t,a\right)$
\end_inset

 which are stored in an array.

 to avoid double-counting.
 Also,

\begin_layout Standard
In order for Mary to be Barry's mother, three things have to happen:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
she survives until Barry's birth;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
she is in the right breeding state then;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
she has to be the one lucky female amongst all the females that are in the
 right breeding state then.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corresponding equation is arguably harder to follow than either the
 description above or the code below, because for compactness it becomes
 necessary to define a lot of extra symbols.
 Nevertheless, we shall proceed.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\text{A}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\text{B}}$
\end_inset

be the birth-years of Anna and Barry respectively; let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi\left(\Delta t\right)$
\end_inset

 be the probability that a female adult survives at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 more years from "now"; and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 be the breeding-cycle transition matrix, so that if the probability vector
 of an animal being in state (1,2,3) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\left[t\right]}$
\end_inset

, then her probability vector at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\left[t+1\right]}=\Psi p^{\left[t\right]}$
\end_inset

.
 Now define 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\left[0\right]}=\left(0,1,0\right)^{\top}$
\end_inset

which is the probability vector of Mary's breeding state at Anna's birth
 (i.e., certain to be in calving phase), and recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\beta}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the proportion of adult females in "calving phase", ie breeding state.
 Then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Anna and Barry are XmHSP}|b_{\text{A}}b_{\text{B}}\theta\right]\nonumber \\
=\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Anna's mum was also Barry's mum}|b_{\text{A}}b_{\text{B}}\theta\right]\nonumber \\
=\frac{\Phi\left(b_{\text{B}}-b_{\text{A}}-1\right)\times\left[\Psi^{b_{\text{B}}-b_{\text{A}}}p^{\left[0\right]}\right]_{2}}{N_{\text{ad}\female}\left(b_{\text{B}}\right)\times\bar{\beta}_{2}}\label{eq:xmhsp}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

where the subscript "2" means that we need the second element of the vector
 inside the square-brackets, i.e.
 the probability that Mary (given she was alive) was in calving phase at
 Barry's birth.
 (This could also have been written in a more POP-like way using probabilities-o
f-breeding state, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Br}\left(\text{Mary},b_{\text{B}}=2\right)|\text{Br}\left(\text{Mary},b_{\text{A}}\right)=1\right]$
\end_inset

, but with no particular benefit.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The walrus setting (or our assumptions about it) has actually made this
 probability rather simpler than it can be in other cases.
 In particular, all adult female walruses are assumed to have equal survival
 probabilities, regardless of age and breeding phase; and the breeding cycle
 is Markovian, so that once a walrus has reached calving-phase (like Mary
 at Anna's birth) her age does not affect her subsequent breeding phases
 nor her survival.
 In a "fish-like" situation, Mary's age (and size) at Anna's birth would
 also be important, because it affects both her subsequent future survival
 probabilities, and her fecundity if she reaches Barry's birthdate.
 Thus for "fish" it is necessary to sum across all the possible ages that
 Mary might have had, weighted by the probability that she was that age
 given that she was Anna's mother.

The importance or otherwise of allowing for skip-breeding in HSP probabilities
 is not immediately obvious.
 Clearly, if Mary breeds only every 3rd year, then her lifetime-average
 reproductive output is only 1/3 of a hypothetical breed-every-year female.
 However, if everybody breeds only every 3rd year, then Mary is only competing
 against 1/3 of the population every time, so those factors broadly cancel
 out; is lifetime-average reproductive output largely unaffected? To a very
 coarse approximation the answer is yes; but a more detailed calculation
 using geometric progressions shows that there is in fact an appreciable
 bias which depends on the skip-interval and the survival rate (see subsection
\begin_inset space ~

 below).
 For walrus, the "naive" no-skip-breeding HSP bias might be of the order
 of 10%, based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim95\%$
\end_inset

 annual adult survival and an average 4-year gap between successful breedings,
 which is enough to justify avoiding it by the more elaborate calculation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This subsection is a mathematical treatment that does not apply directly
 to walrus, because we have already allowed for the female walrus' breeding
 cycle in our CKMR probabilities.
 Its purpose is to explain why failure to allow for semi-regular skip-breeding
 would otherwise lead to some bias in HSP-derived estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (adult abundance, loosely defined).
 This is not obvious, so we provide a derivation that provides an indication
 of the size of bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of skip-breeding is that there is a regular 
\emph on
minimum
\emph default
 breeding interval.
 For simplicity, we just consider the case where breeding can only occur
 every 2nd (or, later on, every 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset


\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
th
\end_layout

\end_inset

) year.
 To "zeroth order", it might be expected that this makes no difference to
 the expected number of HSPs overall; although the mother of sample #1 only
 gets to breed every second year subsequently, whenever she does she only
 has to compete against half the females in the population, so the two effects
 cancel out.
 This is reasonable, but neglects the possibility of the mother dying in-between.
 Before equationizing all this, it is worth noting that skip-breeding has
 minimal effect on the estimation of 
\emph on
survival
\emph default
 from HSPs; the probability of finding an HSP-pair diminishes by a factor
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{k}$
\end_inset

 every 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 years whether there are skips or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the expected number of (maternal, say) later-born HSPs of any given
 sample Sally, based on one comparison per subsequent cohort.
 Each such comparison has probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 of having the same mother as Sally, 
\emph on
iff
\emph default
 that mother is still alive.
 For a species without skip-spawning (i.e.
 with a typical breeding interval of just 1 year), this expected number
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}$
\end_inset

 is therefore given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
H_{1}\triangleq\frac{s}{N}+\frac{s^{2}}{N}+\frac{s^{3}}{N}+\cdots=\frac{N^{-1}s}{1-s}\label{eq:H1}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

because there is only probability 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 that the mother will survive from one year to the next.
 (Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is sometimes used instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 elsewhere in this document.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a similar situation in a species with a 2-year gap, the equation is
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
H_{2}\triangleq0+\frac{s^{2}}{N/2}+0+\frac{s^{4}}{N/2}+...=\frac{2N^{-1}s^{2}}{1-s^{2}}\label{eq:H2}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

because there cannot be any maternal HSPs from odd-numbered later cohorts,
 but in the even-numbered later cohorts the mother (if alive) only has to
 compete against half the overall adults, since the remainder will be skipping
 that year.
 Thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\frac{H_{2}}{H_{1}}=\frac{2s}{1+s}\label{eq:Hrat21}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

 and since 
\begin_inset Formula $s<1$
\end_inset

, the ratio is below 1— although not much below for a long-lived species
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s\approx1$
\end_inset

.
 Misapplying a "no-skip" 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}$
\end_inset

-style model when there are "only" the number of HSPs from an 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

-situation, would lead to a positive bias in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{N}$
\end_inset

 (there are generally fewer HSPs from an 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

-situation than an 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}$
\end_inset

-situation for the same 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can generalize this to a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-year skip-breeding cycle:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
H_{k}\triangleq0+0+\cdots+\frac{s^{k}}{N/k}+\cdots+\frac{s^{2k}}{N/k}+\cdots=\frac{kN^{-1}s^{k}}{1-s^{k}}\nonumber \\
\implies\frac{H_{k}}{H_{1}}=\frac{ks^{k-1}\left(1-s\right)}{1-s^{k}}\label{eq:Hratk1}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For further algebraic insight, we can define the death rate 
\begin_inset Formula $d\triangleq1-s$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $d\ll1$
\end_inset

 for a long-lived species, and expand in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\frac{H_{k}}{H_{1}}=\frac{k\left(1-d\right)^{k-1}d}{1-\left(1-d\right)^{k}}\nonumber \\
=\frac{k\left(1-\left(k-1\right)d+O\left(d^{2}\right)\right)d}{1-\left(1-kd+\tfrac{1}{2}k\left(k-1\right)d^{2}+O\left(d^{3}\right)\right)}\nonumber \\
=\frac{kd\left(1-\left(k-1\right)d+O\left(d^{2}\right)\right)}{kd\left(1-\tfrac{1}{2}(k-1)d+O\left(d^{2}\right)\right)}\nonumber \\
=\left(1-\left(k-1\right)d+O\left(d^{2}\right)\right)\left(1+\tfrac{1}{2}\left(k-1\right)d+O\left(d^{2}\right)\right)\nonumber \\
=1-\tfrac{1}{2}\left(k-1\right)d+O\left(d^{2}\right)\label{eq:Hratd}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for given 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, the bias gets worse as 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 gets larger; but note that, across taxa, we would generally expect 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 to be negatively correlated since there is no point in having a long skip-breed
ing interval if you are unlikely to survive until the other end of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some situations, it might reasonably be argued that bias of this magnitude
 is either unimportant, or reasonably accommodated by just using a "vanilla"
 (skip-free) HSP model with a pre- or post-calculated adjustment based on
 (anticipated, or estimated) survival rate and skip-breeding interval.
 In other words, the "vanilla" probability could be multiplied by a fixed
 factor 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 before use in the log-likelihood, in exactly the same way as the false-negative
 rate is accommodated.
 For walrus, with 
\begin_inset Formula $d\approx0.05$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 perhaps 3 or 4, perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $b=0.9$
\end_inset

 would do a reasonable job.
 While not strictly valid statistically (because uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is ignored, and because 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 might in practice be "calculated" after-the-fact based on survival estimates,
 and then re-inserted in a second iteration of estimation), the offence
 would often be small.
 That said: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the actual bias will also depend on the temporal distribution of samples
 (the calculations above assume infinite future sampling, and a constant
 number of samples per year), so the "ideal" correction is not the same
 as the simplest one; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
it is not usually 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 that difficult to devise a bespoke probability formula that properly accommodat
es biological nuances and avoids "all" bias, just as we have done here for
 walrus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that 
\emph on
lethal-sample
\emph default
 POPs are hardly affected (unless there is correlation between breeding
 state and sampling probability, in which case a "vanilla" POP model might
 not work anyway).
 By the time the adult is lethally sampled, the offspring must already be
 born, so there is no "discounting" due to potential mortality.
 This would usually cover most POPs in the non-lethal case, too.
 With non-lethal samples, the effect on POP probabilities would depend whether
 sampling probability is linked to breeding-cycle status.
 For this report, we have generally assumed that it does not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Self-recapture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted previously, we only consider female samples for self-recapture,
 since juvenile males are prone to "permanent emigration" as well as true
 mortality, so do not yield readily-interpretable inferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 used a fairly complex IMR formulation to cope with historically-very-imprecise
 estimates of age (or, more realistically, of "stage") estimates.
 However, when accurate age data are available, the pairwise comparison
 probabilities for self-recapture are remarkably simple.
 Suppose two female samples are available with 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1},a_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2},a_{2}$
\end_inset

 in obvious notation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 for definiteness.
 Then the probability that the first one (#1) is the same as the second
 is just
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[K_{12}=\text{SP}|y_{1}a_{1}y_{2}a_{2}\right]=\mathbf{I}\left(y_{2}-a_{2}=y_{1}-a_{1}\right)/N_{\female}\left(y_{1},a_{1}\right)\label{eq:SP}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indicator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{I}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 is 1 if the two samples were born in the same year, or 0 if not; clearly,
 they can only be from the same animal if they were both born in the same
 year! If they were, then there is precisely one female alive at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 with age 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 who later became the second sample; and the chance that the first sample
 is that very female is the reciprocal of all such females, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\female}(y_{1},a_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 The implicit assumption here is simply that all females of the same age
 have the same survival and sampling probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation can also be formulated "the other way round", i.e., considering
 whether the second sample is the same as the first.
 The answer turns out the same, but the derivation is slightly different
 and 
\emph on
appears
\emph default
 to involve an explicit survival term.
 Specifically, we write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[K_{12}=\text{SP}|y_{1}a_{1}y_{2}a_{2}\right]\nonumber \\
=\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Sample 2 turns out to be the same animal as sample 1}|y_{1}a_{1}y_{2}a_{2}\right]\nonumber \\
=\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Sample 1 survived until Sample 2 was taken}\right]\times\mathbf{I}\left(y_{2}-a_{2}=y_{1}-a_{1}\right)}{N_{\female}\left(y_{2},a_{2}\right)}\nonumber \\
=\frac{\Phi\left(y_{2}-y_{1};a_{1}\right)\times\mathbf{I}\left(y_{2}-a_{2}=y_{1}-a_{1}\right)}{N_{\female}\left(y_{2},a_{2}\right)}\label{eq:other-way-round-self}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the results are readily seen to be identical because, by definition
 of "survival", we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}

 In practice, that would be ridiculous, since it would require an enormous
 number of recaptures and would lead to noisy abundance estimates, estimated
 survivals greater than one, and so on.
 However, the principle does illustrate the great power of 
\emph on
known-age
\emph default
 mark-recapture data.
 Note also that there are no assumptions about equiprobable sampling across
 ages, etc; all probabilities are simply conditioned on observed ages, and

\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:SP"

\end_inset

) in an ICKMR setting, i.e., with conditioning on age explicitly, is that
 it requires explicit calculation of all 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(y,a\right)$
\end_inset

 within the model.
 This is normally unnecessary with mammalesque CKMR, where the main information
 is 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 connected with aggregate adult abundance (via TRO).
 It is extremely convenient to work just with a "homogenous block" of adults,
 and there is in any case no direct information on population age composition
 unless extra data are used.
 One option is "just" to work with a fully-age-structured population dynamics
 framework— but that is a lot of work to develop (from experience in fisheries
 work) and requires modeling extra data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this project we have gone for a different option, which only uses "stage-stru
ctured" dynamics (adults and juveniles).
 This keeps the population dynamics simple, but to handle the IMR data,
 we do have to make extra assumptions about sampling selectivity.
 We assume that (
\shape italic
i
\shape default
) all (female) adults are equally likely to be sampled in a given year (i.e.,
 that probability does not depend on age, provided the animal is adult),
 and (
\shape italic
ii
\shape default
) that all juveniles age 1–6 are also equally likely— although juveniles
 overall may have different sampling probabilities to adults.
 That assumption may turn out to be unreasonable for juveniles especially;
 but it will only be possible to check once enough sample-age-composition
 data become available.
 However, if it does turn out to be the case that (say) 2yo are disproportionate
ly likely to be sampled (given their estimated abundance from the fitted
 model), then it would not be hard to adjust the stage-structured IMR equations
 to incorporate sample-composition-data and (estimated) selectivity.
 Sample sizes in this project are large enough that selectivity (i.e., the
 ratio of age-specific sample compositions to model-estimated pouplation
 age compositions) should be estimated with respectable precision and without
 "propagating" a lot of uncertainty into other parameter estimates.
 We therefore think that our current somewhat crude IMR sub-model should
 give a reasonable guide to ultimate precision, even if it gets adjusted
 somewhat in the cold light of real data.
 Note that similar assumptions appear to be made in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (to be confirmed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compute stage-structured self-recapture probabilities, we condition on
 the age of the first sample but 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 explicitly on the age of the second sample.
 However, we do condition on whether the second sample was juvenile (1–6)
 or adult (7+) at sampling, i.e., its "Devstage".
 If the age of the first, plus the intervening time between samples, would
 place the first sample in a different Devstage to the second sample, then
 the two cannot be the same animal.
 If the first sample would have reached the right Devstage, then we assume
 it is equally likely to be 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 of the females in that Devstage at that year (i.e., sampling is unselective
 within Devstage) and thus the chance it is the same as the second sample
 is the reciprocal of the Devstage abundance.
 The other consideration, of course, is that the first sample may not have
 survived the intervening years.
 This leads to the quite-simple code shown in Listing

\mathbb{P}\left[\text{Sandy (sampled second) turns out to be the same animal as Freya (sampled first)}|a_{\text{F}}y_{\text{F}}d_{\text{S}}y_{\text{S}}\right]\nonumber \\

\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where: 
\begin_inset Formula $a/y/d_{\text{F/S}}$
\end_inset

 is the age, sampling year, or Devstage of Freya or Sandy as appropriate;
 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 is the function that maps age to Devstage, with 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(a<7\right)=\text{"Juvenile"}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(a\geqslant7\right)=\text{"Adult"}$
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\female}\left(y,d\right)=\sum_{a}\mathbf{I}\left[d\left(a\right)=d\right]N_{\female}\left(y,a\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For devstage "Adult , the abundance is just 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{ad}\female}\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 which is explicitly a variable in the population dynamics but, since the
 latters is not formulated with explicit age structure, some more work is
 required to deduce 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\female}\left(y,\text{Juvenile}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key is the quasi-equilibrium assumption, i.e.
 that the age composition is (except perhaps for the oldest adults) stable
 over time, even if abundance as a whole is increasing or decreasing.
 The basic idea is that the number of juveniles leaving that Devstage should,
 after mortality, match the number of adults entering the Adult devstage
 in the next year; and the basic tool is the Geometric Progression.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 be the first age of adulthood, and assume that survival continues "forever"
 so that we can use infinite sums (and so we can avoid several other inconvenien
ces in the CKMR equations that would require an explicit representation
 of age structure).
 Dropping the female subscript for brevity, and writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{a}=\Phi\left(1,a\right)$
\end_inset

 for one-year survival, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
N\left(y+1,a+1\right)=\phi_{a}N\left(y,a\right)\,\,\forall\,y,a\text{ [survival]}\nonumber \\
N\left(y+1,a\right)=\rho N\left(y,a\right)\,\,\forall\,y,a\text{ [increase/decrease at rate \ensuremath{\rho}]}\nonumber \\
\implies N\left(y,a+1\right)=\phi_{a}N\left(y-1,a\right)=\frac{\phi_{a}}{\rho}N\left(y,a\right)\nonumber \\
\implies N\left(y,a+t\right)=\left(\frac{\phi_{a}}{\rho}\right)^{t}N\left(y,a\right)\text{ if \ensuremath{\phi}is constant between \ensuremath{a} and \ensuremath{a+t-1} }\nonumber \\
\implies N_{\text{ad}}\left(y\right)=\sum_{a\geqslant\alpha}N\left(y,\alpha\right)\left(\frac{\phi_{\text{ad}}}{\rho}\right)^{a-\alpha}=\frac{N\left(y,\alpha\right)}{1-\phi_{\text{ad}}/\rho}\text{ [total adult abundance relative to new incoming adults] }\nonumber \\
\implies N\left(y,\alpha\right)=\left(1-\phi_{\text{ad}}/\rho\right)\times N_{\text{ad}}\left(y\right)\nonumber \\
\implies N\left(y-1,\alpha-1\right)\text{\ensuremath{\phi_{\text{ju}}=}}\left(1-\phi_{\text{ad}}/\rho\right)\times N_{\text{ad}}\left(y\right)\text{ [same cohort one year earlier]}\nonumber \\

The individual-based simulation is stochastic and operates on an annual
 basis.
 Individuals are tracked through the use of unique identifiers so that kinship
 pairs can be identified in simulated samples.
 We initialized the simulation in 1950 with a population of 250,000 animals.
 These individuals are considered

 and do not have mothers or fathers.
 The age and sex-structure of the initial population is determined by the
 survival rates used in the simulation (Table

), which were provided by Rebecca Taylor.
 Individuals that are at or beyond the age of first reproduction mate randomly
 and males are not exhausted; i.e., a male could potentially father more than
 one calf.
 Females reproduction follows a Markov process with three states, as described
 in Section

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Females that are in the right state of the breeding cycle give birth to
 a single offspring with 1:1 sex ratio.
 There is no systematic age-effect on female reproductive dynamics, except
 that they are guaranteed not-pregnant in the year immediately prior to
 maturity (again as per Section

 adulthood until the Markov process has settled down.

In sampling years, captures are simulated according to either historical
 or planned future sample sizes.
 Females are available to be sampled at any age, while only calf and juvenile
 (< 7yr old) males are available for sampling.
 For simulated captures between 2014 and 2017, we used the realized sample
 sizes by age class as the basis for simulation.
 For simulated captures between 2023 and 2027, we used the target number
 samples per age class as the basis for simulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After sampling, some individuals die (according to age and/or sex specific
 mortality rates, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 If a female with a dependent calf dies, her calf becomes independent.
 Individuals automatically die if they reach the maximum age.
 The simulation then ages all individuals that are still alive (i.e., increases
 their age by 1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The female breeding cycle is as described in rotated through a multi-year
 breeding cycle .
 Females enter Stage 3 the cycle (not pregnant) when they turn 5 (since
 age of first reproduction is 7, they may get pregnant at 6).
 From Stage 3, they can either move to Stage 1 (pregnant) or stay in Stage
 3 according to the probability of breeding at a 3-yr+ interval.
 From Stage 1, females must move to Stage 2: with dependent calf.
 Although we nominally assume in the simulation that 100% of pregnancies
 result in live births, this rate is aliased with the nominal calf-survival
 probability, since (at least for now) only samples from 1yo onwards are
 considered; only the product (nominal pregnancy success rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 nominal calf survival) affects the simulated samples, not the two constituent
 parameters.
 From Stage 2, females can either move back to Stage 1: pregnant according
 to the probability of breeding at 2-yr interval, or move to Stage 3.
 Males and non-breeding females are exempt from this cycle.

\begin_layout Standard
Although CKMR "magick" lets us avoid massive repeated simulations for the
 purposes of 
\emph on
evaluating
\emph default
 a proposed design, the best way to 
\emph on
check
\emph default
 the code of a complicated CKMR model is to see if it gives unbiased estimates
 against simulated data— which does require repeated simulations.
 However, the walrus CKMR R code is pretty slow (which does not matter for
 design-evaluation, since it only needs to be evaluated about 
\begin_inset Formula $2p$
\end_inset

 times where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the number of parameters) to the point that it could not practicably
 be used to fit lots of simulated datasets.
 But fitting turns out to be unnecessary, since we can approximate the outcome
 of fitting quite well with simpler and faster calculations.
 For each newly-drawn dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{*}$
\end_inset

, we can readily evaluate the "Score vector", i.e.
 the derivatives of the log-likelihood at the true parameter values, written
 as
\begin_inset Formula $\left.d\Lambda\left(y^{*};\theta\right)/d\theta\right\vert _{\theta_{0}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda'\left(y^{*};\theta_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These Scores should on average (across simulations) be close to 0 if the
 model and simulation agree.
 The definition of "close enough" can be determined relative to the Fisher
 Information 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{H}=-\mathbb{E}\left[\left.d^{2}\Lambda/d\theta^{2}\right\vert _{\theta_{0}}\right]$
\end_inset

, which is already being calculated for design use thanks to special properties
 of CKMR.
 We can use a similar idea to approximately find the MLE 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}\left(y^{*}\right)$
\end_inset

, just given the Fisher Information and the Score.
 Taking a Taylor expansion of the Score around the true parameter value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, and putting the result the implicit equation that defines the MLE, which
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda'\left(y^{*};\hat{\theta}\left(y^{*}\right)\right)=0$
\end_inset

 or just 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda'\left(\hat{\theta}\right)$
\end_inset

 for short, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\Lambda'\left(\hat{\theta}\right)=0\nonumber \\
\implies\Lambda'\left(\theta_{0}\right)+\Lambda''\left(\theta_{0}\right)\cdot\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta_{0}\right)\approx0\nonumber \\
\implies\hat{\theta}\approx\theta_{0}+\bar{H}^{-1}\cdot\Lambda'\left(\theta_{0}\right)\label{eq:approx-MLE}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is actually quite a good approximation to the full MLE, at least for
 reasonably informative datasets, since the observed and expected Fisher
 Information matrices tend to be close in practice.
 The point is that we can easily use eqn
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:approx-MLE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) to examine the distribution of (approximate) MLEs across simulated datasets,
 without actually needing to fit the model and its rather slow R code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While simulating an entire CKMR dataset 
\emph on
de novo 
\emph default
is very slow (it is individual-based population dynamics over 50+ years),
 for model-testing it suffices to simulate 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 entire population history, then repeatedly sample entire datasets from
 that history— a much quicker process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As yet, there has not been enough time to explore these tests against multiple
 simulated datasets, but we have used one dataset to make a simpler comparison,
 between total observed and expected kin-pairs.
 As shown in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:sim-comp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the model predictions are a bit high.
 For MOPs the numbers are close enough to be statistical noise, but the
 other two kinshsips are showing significant differences, and about a 20%
 "effect size".
 There must be some discrepancy; the code for both parts (including the
 mundane but lengthy operation of digesting the simulation data into a form
 directly suitable for CKMR log-likelihoods) is reasonably complex, and
 there is plenty of scope for things to differ.
 However, the numbers do not seem so far apart as to undermine the model's
 use for general precision statements.
 It is perhaps worth noting that the approximate MLE for this dataset, as
 alluded to in the previous paragraph is actually quite close to the (allegedly)
 true parameter values.

\begin_layout Standard
One source of discrepancy that we have spotted already, is that adult mortality
 starts at age 6 in the simulation, but at age 7 in the model.
 This leads to about 5% more adults in the simulation compared to the estimation
 with the "same" parameter values, which will tend inflate the predicted
 number of kin-pairs by a comparable amount.
 This would put the MOPs almost exactly on target (not that they need to
 be exact, based on one dataset), and reduce the other differences to about
 15%.
 This is part of the story, but unlikely to be the whole story behind Table
 (sim-comp).

\begin_layout Standard
A few observations may be made:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Abundance estimates are most precise around the middle of the "period" (i.e.,
 the range of birth-cohorts of potential offspring and half-siblings).
 The greater uncertainty near the ends reflects that the RoI is uncertain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Juvenile abundance is less precise than adult abundance.
 The latter is directly estimated by CKMR (as well as IMR); the former is
 directly estimated only by IMR, but is also informed by back-projected
 adult abundance estimates combined with juvenile survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The SE on relative 
\emph on
change
\emph default
 in abundance over a 10-year period (2015 to 2025; 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{A}$
\end_inset

) is about 0.06, ie 6%.
 Since the point estimate is basically "no change", the 90% confidence interval
 on relative change is about 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1.645*6=\text{\ensuremath{\pm}}10\%$
\end_inset

.
 That might seem rather wide, but a 10% change in 10 years is really not
 very much.
 This is an impressive result for (in effect) RoI, which from experience
 requires a good span of birth-cohorts and large numbers of kin-pairs for
 accurate estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Survival estimates, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\text{breed}}$
\end_inset

 (proportion of females calving in any year), are quite precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The POP, HSP, and SelfP data all contain a lot of "direct" information about
 "future recent" (i.e., post-2025 abundance): adult abundance for POP and
 HSP, overall for Self).
 This is because there should be a goodly number of recaptures for which
 the denominator involves a post-2025 abundance.
 Nevertheless, comparing with the 300+ total kin-pairs per category in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:sim-comp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

,, it is clear that the great bulk of recaptures— and thus the great bulk
 of direct demographic information— pertain to earlier years.
 This is largely inevitable with ICKMR studies, since animals born earlier
 have more opportunities to be "recaptured".

 Including CKMR improves precision by a factor of 2 to 3, except for juvenile
 abundance where the with-CKMR version is a mere 50% better.

Utility of "nursing" status
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:nursy"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be possible to obtain fairly-reliable information on whether each
 sampled females was nursing a calf or not (with "accompanied by an older
 juvenile" being a "not").
 This 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 have some value for CKMR estimates, since it informs on a female's state
 within the breeding cycle (state-2 or not-state-2), and thus has an influence
 on her MOP probabilities against animals born soon after or soon before
 her sampling-year; for example, a female cannot normally give birth in
 two successive years.
 We therefore also developed a MOP probability formula analogous to (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:MOP1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) that also condition on "nursingness" (i.e., with vs without calf), and explored
 what impact this extra conditioning data would have on overal precision.
 In brief, the answer is: minimal.
 The difference is practically undetectable for the abundance and survival
 parameters, although the breeding-cycle parameters are about 15% more precise
 using nursingness.
 From a modeling perspective, if nursing data was to be used at all, it
 would be much easier to build a separate log-likelihood component for "proporti
on observed nursing", but not to use individual measurements in conditioning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the effect on precision is too small to make the modelling (and
 field) complications worthwhile, it is worth pointing out that a nursingness-co
nditioned MOP CKMR model is theoretically robust to any sampling-selectivity
 differences between nursing and non-nursing females.
 It might be easier, or harder, to sample the latter.
 The standard MOP formula (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:MOP1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) implicitly assumes equal sampling probability, and so 
\emph on
might 
\emph default
be biased if that is not true.
 However, most MOP recaptures are well-separated in time, and after a couple
 of years the effects on current fecundity of being nursing-or-not a few
 years ago soon becomes unimportant.
 From a practical perspective, we therefore doubt there is much CKMR-related
 reason to include nursingness data at all (though it might be interesting
 in its own right, from a less narrow-minded perspective!).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have also thought about the potential value of recording "juvenile-accompanie
d" status for sampled (presumably adult) females.
 Our conclusion is that it would not be useful for CKMR, aside from the
 logistical challenges of getting reliable information during the hectic
 process of sampling.
 The original reason for thinking about it was in connection with spatial
 models, but those are are now "parked" until and unless ever needed.
 However, given the very limited gains anticipated from "nursing" data,
 it seems doubtful whether less-reliable "juvenile-accompanied" data would
 offer any worthwhile gain even in a spatial setting.

\begin_layout Subsection
Adjusting future sample composition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The precision of CKMR estimates can vary appreciably depending on the age
 composition of samples; for lethally-sampled fish, animals around the age
 of maturity tend to be less useful than younger or older ones, beccause
 they get fewer opportunities to "mark" offspring than the older ones, but
 are also less effectiing potential offspring because they were born longer
 ago.
 In general, the effects are not at all obvious.
 Depending on the species, it may sometimes be possible to tweak the sampling
 strategy, at least at the coarse level of targeting more juveniles or more
 adults.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows the effects of changing future sampling strategy towards or away
 from juveniles.
 In these variants, annual sample sizes are kept constant, but the per capita
 sampling probabilities of juveniles vs adults are altered relative to the
 default scheme (which uses the age composition of pre-2020 samples).
 The quantitative effects on precision are remarkably small, perhaps because
 so many samples are already available, and because non-lethal sampling
 allows animals to be "future parents".
 At a coarse level, Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:change-comp-secv"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 certainly does not provide any reason to change an existing strategy which
 should be very successful.
 It is noticeable, though, that oversampling juveniles does tend to increase
 the "recently useful" kin-pairs, which 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 improve the ability to detect 
\emph on
changes
\emph default
 in population dynamics at the (very slight) expense of reducing historical
 precision.
 A more flexible model would be needed to investigate that thoroughly.
 In any case, oversampling juveniles might not be logistically possible,
 or might incur an excessive cost in terms of lost adult sampling opportunities;
 that is is a separate but crucial question.

\begin_layout Standard
One caveat on these 
\emph on
estimated
\emph default
 precisions—impressive as they certainly are—is that they are closely tied
 to model correctness, and the quasi-steady-state model we have used is
 rather inflexible.
 With less-informative datasets, correctness or otherwise often does not
 matter; poetically speaking, the mountain of bias is usually submerged
 under a vast sea of uncertainty.
 However, as the quantity of data (recaptures) increases, the sea is drained
 and the mountain may become visible, or at least a shipping hazard.

\begin_layout Subsection
Qualitative design calculations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we have investigated 
\emph on
quantitative
\emph default
 precision under a "steady-as-she-goes" population dynamics model; abundance
 may be increasing or decreasing, but is assumed to be doing so steadily,
 and with the implied quasi-equilbrium age structure.
 Since nothing particularly drastic is thought to have happened to the Pacific
 walrus population since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim\text{AD}2000$
\end_inset

, the model should deliver a usefully precise estimate of average abundance
 over that period, and at least place reasonable limits on any trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reality, of course, population dynamics do not remain completely stable
 for ever; the environment or the exploitation patterns may changes, an
 epidemic may burn through, and even if nothing else really changes, density-dep
endence is guaranteed to eventually kick-in unless the population is completely
 stable.
 A big motivation for monitoring is to be able to detect such changes— not
 necessarily via statistical yes/no hypothesis tests (hopefully not), but
 at least by noticing that observed and predicted values of some measurable
 quantity are diverging— or, if the modeling frame is sophisticated enough
 and the data powerful enough, by seeing that estimates of potentially-time-vary
ing parameters are moving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current model does not include time-varying parameters.
 A foolhardy ingenue could keep using this model indefinitely as new data
 comes in;
\emph on
 
\emph default
it is true that, if the dynamics really do change (e.g., if carrying capacity
 halves), then the current model will 
\emph on
eventually
\emph default
 respond by changing estimated average abundance.
 In practice, that would happen through progressive shifts in the estimated
 RoI, and to a lesser extent in the reference-year abundance estimate.
 But this would still be a very coarse view of population dynamics; if the
 population was originally increasing over a 20-year period and has since
 decreased over the next 20 years, then it is not very useful to have the
 model say "things are stable"; that might arguably be a reasonable if coarse
 summary of the past 40 years, but would be a terrible guide for predictions.
 It would take a long time for new data to wash out the traces of the original
 dataset that was collected before the great population dynamics shift—
 possibly far longer than one would expect of a responsible monitoring program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One albeit-largely-theoretical advantage of line-transect-style surveys
 (i.e., where aggregate abundance is estimated 
\shape italic
de novo
\shape default
 every time) is that they respond quickly; if the true abundance halves
 because of an epidemic, the abundance 
\emph on
index
\emph default
 is likely to halve, too.
 In practice, this is a largely theoretical advantage, because the CVs on
 annual or regular surveys are usually so large that it takes a long time
 to accumulate strong-enough evidence— especially if changes are more subtle,
 as they usually are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, CK and MR demographic monitoring (of abundance and other things)
 is intrinsically model-based
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In some situations one might be able to construct a series of "single-sample"
 Lincoln-Peterson-type MR estimates made independently, but that is usually
 not an efficient use of data, and makes little sense when there are "shared"
 demographic parameters such as survival rates.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and operates on an entire time-series at once.
 (The same is largely true of fish stock assessment, which often uses "independe
nt" annual abundance indices but only within the context of an overarching
 population dynamics model that incorporates all data at once.) Although
 we use a simple and rigid pouplation dynamics model in this report, the
 CKMR and IMR data do in principle provide enough information to fit very
 flexible population-dynamics models that respond quite quickly to changes
 (e.g.
 decreased calf production).
 However, it is a rather subtle question as to 
\emph on
when
\emph default
 abundance is "really" being estimated, and thus how quickly a CKMR monitoring
 program can expect to respond to changes.
 The next section gives some mathematical\SpecialChar breakableslash
theoretical perspective, followed

Pairwise kinship probabilities are always determined by what was happening
 at the birth of of (one or both) members; at that time, there is always
 an element of "competition" between one animal and all others for the "honour"
 of parenthood.
 However, it is not obvious what this means for the responsiveness of CKMR
 or ICKMR models to changes in abundance; are the empirical data "really"
 telling us about abundance in the distant past, or the near past, or the
 present? To explore this further, consider for simplicity a population
 under lethal sampling where adult females can breed every year and are
 reproductively homogenous, with abundance 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{y}$
\end_inset

 in year 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The MOP probability for a potential-offspring born in year

Thus the information is all back-dated to the birth of the potential-offspring.
 Even without an explicit population dynamics model (e.g.
 in extremis allowing the

 abundance for any past year where a sample was born; however, there will
 not be many suitable comparisons for the most recent years.

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 is the adult survival probability (here assumed constant in age and time
 for simplicity).
 This is simply the probability that #1's mother survives the intervening
 years, divided by the competition she will then experience to be #2's mother
 as well.
 The denominator pertains to the birth of the 
\emph on
later-
\emph default
born sample #2.
 The presence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 on the numerator may appear to complicate matters, but in fact 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 could be estimated empirically based (say) on picking any reference year
 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

, and regressing the HSPs-per-comparison from samples born in earlier years
 compared to that year, using time-difference as a covariate; the log-slope
 of the regression is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}$
\end_inset

.
 This would be very inefficient in practice, but it makes the point that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 can be estimated independently of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 [That claim might be unreasonable if we were entertaining the notion that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 might vary substantiallly over time, because we would essentially need
 to extrapolate from past estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 to make eqn

 work.
 However, for a long-lived species it will often be reasonable to assume
 that variations in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 have less impact than variations in surviving calf production, say.] Overall,
 it seems fair to say that the information in HSPs concerns abundance at
 the 
\emph on
later
\emph default
 birth date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation for IMR can in fact be argued either way.
 Given the stage-structured version of IMR considered in this report, where
 it is 
\emph on
assumed
\emph default
 that sampling is unselective 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 development-stage, exactly the same argument applies as for HSPs.
 The probability of self-recapture for two samples taken at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

, where the second sample is in the same development-stage that the first
 would have reached by then, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[\text{SelfP}|by_{1}y_{2}\cdots\right]=\frac{\phi^{y_{2}-y_{1}}}{N_{\text{dev}y_{2}}}\label{eq:simplest-selfP-utd}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

since the animal sampled first has to survive until 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

, and then is competing against all the other animals in that development-stage
 for the "honour" of being the same animal as the one sampled second.
 Again, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 can be estimated independently, so stage-structured IMR is primarily telling
 us about abundance 
\emph on
of a particular development-stage
\emph default
 at the 
\emph on
later
\emph default
 sampling date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, another way to handle IMR would be to take account explicitly of
 the age of both samples (assumed exact for now, though allowance for age
 measurement error does not destroy the principle).
 That makes it impossible for the two samples to be the same animal unless
 they were both born in the same year.
 If they are, then we know the second sample was definitely alive when the
 first one was taken, so the chance it is actually the same animal as the
 first is merely
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[\text{SelfP}|b_{1}=b_{2},y_{1},\cdots\right]=\frac{1}{N_{y_{1},y_{1}-b}}\label{eq:simplest-selfP-age-utd}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

since the first sample could have been any of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{y_{1},y_{1}-b}$
\end_inset

 animals alive at age 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}-b$
\end_inset

 in year 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 From this point-of-view, IMR is entirely retrospective and is actually
 telling us about abundance at the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 sampling date.
 The conundrum is resolved by noting that this is, however, an 
\emph on
age-specific
\emph default
 abundance, and that age-specific abundances (unlike aggregate abundances)
 are linked by the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{y+t,a+t}=N_{ya}\phi^{t}$
\end_inset

 (assuming constant survival).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The broad picture from this somewhat involved discussion is that POPs are
 trying to tell us about past abundance, whereas HSPs and SelfPs are mainly
 trying to tell us about recent abundance.
 There are some qualitative implications for study design: perhaps focussing
 on adults to make sure there are enough distant-past POP comparisons to
 ground the estimates back in time, and enough recent young samples to get
 good current estimates...
 although the recent past now will at some point in the future become the
 distant past, anyway, so that long-term monitoring requirements should
 be anticpated too.
 Overall it is hard to ratiocinate one's way through all this accurately,
 and in the end the Hessian calculations along the lines of this report
 are the only reliable way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that these consequences are masked when imposing a rigid population
 dynamics model, e.g.
 constant rate-of-increase, as in this report.
 However, if there is enough data, then it is of course possible to fit
 a more flexible and responsive population dynamics model after-the-fact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-lethal sampling does not really make this any more complicated, because
 it merely introduces extra factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 which can be estimated anyway.
 For MOPs, though, non-lethal as opposed to lethal sampling should improve
 the number of usable comparisons for the most recently-born cohorts, since
 potential-parents can now be sampled before the birth of those cohorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implications for detecting changes that are outside model scope
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:detecting-changes"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last subsection shows that direct information about adult abundance
 in recent years (i.e.
 in the years leading up to an analysis based on data collected to that
 point) will be driven largely by HSPs and individual recaptures where the
 second sample was taken in those recent years (perhaps not a very surprising
 conclusion).
 Thus, even if one is aiming to infer something about recent abundance in
 as "model-free" a way as possible (to avoid biases arising when reality
 changes but the model cannot, e.g., if survival rates change), it is still
 necessary to wait until the 
\emph on
expected
\emph default
 number of such recaptures is high enough for some degree of statistical
 reliability.
 Crudely put, after enough years have elapsed to expect say 25 HSPs where
 the second animal is from a "recent" cohort,then seeing 35 or more would
 be strong evidence for a substantial decrease in adult abundance 
\emph on
over-and-above
\emph default
 whatever a steady-state model might be suggesting.
 (If the model was structurally appropriate and the parameter estimates
 were precise—as they will be—then the actual number should follow a Poisson
 distribution with mean 25.
 The standard deviation is then 5, so 35 is 2SD away from the mean— significant
 at 5%.) The more intense the sampling, the less time it takes to reach 25
 expected kin-pairs for a given span of "recent" cohorts (or whatever nominal
 threshold one views as "significance-worthy"); hence, the "recent" cohorts
 do not need to extend back as far, and any change would become apparent
 more quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, aside from the quantitative but quasi-steady-state precision
 estimates investigated with the tools described in this report, it is also
 useful to pursue the above line of investigation (based just on expected
 values of a chosen subset of recaps), in the light of discussion about
 "what would we hope to be able to notice?".
 Since all that is needed is predictions of numbers of kin-pairs, the calculatio
ns are quite easy based on the machinery already presented.
 A simple example is shown in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SECV"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and the numbers there are encouraging; it seems the project should be
 able to notice a big change in abundance (and a change in the long-term
 trend) within a 5-year sampling block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of quantitative goodness-of-fit checks can also be made when there
 are sufficient (expected) kin-pairs.
 For example, it is theoretically possible to check for consistent RoI by
 comparing observed-to-expected kin-pairs for different parts of the dataset,
 e.g., different birth-cohorts.
 In previous CKMR design studies, we have sometimes checked the feasibility
 of this for specific spatial hypotheses (e.g.,, whether populations are fully-mix
ed spatially over one generation); see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Similar (presumably non-spatial) ideas could be explored for Pacific walrus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model does not include calves (ie age 0 animals that are clearly visible
 as such, and always accompanied by their mother), and it does not contain
 a term for calf survival (which is likely different to post-calf juvenile
 survival).
 This might be something to revisit in future.
 Our reasons for omitting calves at this point are largely pragmatic, and
 not necessarily compelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason is to avoid "over-tightening" the population dynamics specification.
 The model already includes terms for per capita rate of calf production,
 juvenile survival, adult survival, 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 overall population RoI.
 The latter is, by definition, the leading eigenvalue of a Leslie matrix
 for the female life-cycle, in which calf survival is a parameter; so, logically
, we 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 simply deduce the calf survival from the estimates of all other parameters
 in the model.
 If we estimated a specific calf survival parameter, then it would be necessary
 to eliminate one other "free" parameter (presumably RoI), and instead deduce
 the RoI as an "emergent property" of calf survival plus all other parameters.
 That has the technical overhead of needing to find an eigenvalue; not impossibl
e, but tedious at least when the model has to be converted to a low-level
 language like TMB.
 On the whole, CKMR can do a reasonable job of estimating RoI just from
 "kin trends", without relying on indirect inference from other population
 dynamics parameters: for example, if there more POPs per comparison for
 offspring-cohorts born later rather than earlier
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Amongst comparisons made against "suitable" adults in each case, i.e.
 adults  that would have been alive and mature at offspring birth.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, then that indicates a decline in the number of adults.
 Our suspicion is that kin-trend data is the most robust source of information
 on RoI, since e.g., it does not rely on our detailed assumptions about the
 breeding cycle.
 Thus, we opted to dispense with calf survival in the model altogether,
 at least for now; it is not necessary for the rest of the demographics
 (although estimating it might help with the other parameters, particularly
 RoI— 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 the details of the demographic model are correct).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the calf survival rate is of biological interest, and there
 is information about it from POPs as well as from self-recaps.
 For example, consider a calf Cynthia born in 2020 and sampled that year,
 and a 1yo juvenile Jill also born in 2020 but sampled in 2021.
 The probability that Cynthia goes on to become a mother of a subsequent
 sample, is lower than the chance that Jill does, simply because Cynthia
 has to survive one extra year.
 The same argument goes for self-recaptures of Cynthia and Jill.
 The ratio of the Cynthia-to-Jill-type probabilities (which could be estimated
 empirically based on many "Cynthias" and "Jills") is the calf survival
 rate.
 This could be estimated directly "outside" the current formulation of the
 CKMR model (and a fairly simple calculation based on sample sizes could
 be used to explore likely precision).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calf survival aside, the value of calf samples for CKMR in general needs
 to be considered as part of the design exercise.
 There is presumably some additional logistic effort required to get samples
 from both a mother and calf—effort which might or might not be usefully
 redirectable, such as sampling more adult females instead—so it is worth
 investigating the statistical information trade-offs.
 Although a calf does provide CKMR information about breeding male adults
 (via its father), we have already abandoned the notion of modelling males.
 Therefore, from a CKMR point-of-view a calf sample is mostly just a "surrogate"
 for its accompanying mother.
 If another offspring of the mother is subsequently found, then it will
 automatically be a maternal half-sib of the calf, and vice versa; thus,
 there is no additional statistical information to be gained 
\emph on
via CKMR
\emph default
 from adding the calf sample 
\emph on
as a potential offspring or half-sib
\emph default
 (if the mother is already sampled) or adding the mother sample (if the
 calf is already sampled).
 And if the calf gets sampled but the mother accidentally does not, we can
 effectively treat the calf as a surrogate for its mother.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be possible to investigate the general power of calf samples for
 inferences about other parameters (i.e., not just about calf survival) without
 changing our model.
 We could implement this using existing code, but have not tried it yet.
 The proposed recipe, if a calf is sampled but not its mother, is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
artificially increase the female-adult sample size that year by 1;
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the only catch is that the implicit-mother's age would not be known; hence
 there is some loss of information in having a calf-only sample, as opposed
 to a mother-only or mother-plus-calf.
 We ignore that here, since an adult female's age does not 
\emph on
strongly
\emph default
 affect most of her POP-comparison probabilities in a long-lived species
 with fairly constant fecundity-at-age.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
do not "count" the calf sample as a potential-offspring nor as a potential-HS;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
if any HSPs of that calf are found, treat them as offspring of the "implicit
 mother"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
do
\emph default
 use the calf sample (if female) as a potential 
\emph on
parent
\emph default
 of future samples.
 (This implicitly entails some assumption about calf survival, thus contradictin
g the general comments above...
 A reasonable guess might be to increase the sample size of 1yo potential
 parents in the 
\emph on
next
\emph default
 sampling year by 1 or 0.9.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a female calf 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 her mother are both sampled, then only the final dot-point is relevant;
 the calf can be discarded from potential-offspring and potential-HS sample
 sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because a calf 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 reappear later as a parent, 
\emph on
female 
\emph default
calf samples do have some CKMR value whether or not their mother is sampled
 (aside from their role in directly estimating calf survival, as already
 noted).
 However, because such a reappearance would take many years, and because
 the calf might well die before adulthood anyway, the expected statistical
 information from a calf (even unaccompanied) may not be large.
 It is certainly true that a calf sample will provide less demographic informati
on than a sample from a separate non-calf (which is more likely to be female,
 since male juveniles tend to undergo "permanent emigration" from the summer
 sampling grounds), 
\emph on
except
\emph default
 about calf survival rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the above argument does not apply to juveniles sampled at age
 1+, since they may not be accompanying their mother, and the sampling process
 is likely to be more "separate".
 When the real data arrive, it would be worth checking how common it is
 for a mother and a 1+ juvenile to be sampled in the same year; if it is
 common, then some sample-size adjustments to reflect "redundant comparisons"
 might be warranted.

Will the data be too good for this model?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The anticipated precision from the walrus project is substantially better
 than from any existing CKMR study, and we suspect it is also better than
 the great majority of IMR studies too.
 However, the CVs above are contingent on the correctness of the population
 dynamics model.
 The latter makes quasi-steady-state assumptions which may not be appropriate;
 it is possible, for example, that survival and breeding rates have changed
 appreciably between 2000 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim2025$
\end_inset

.
 CKMR datasets are typically much less informative than this one will be,
 so a certain amount of model error is unimportant; any bias will likely
 be swamped by imprecision anyway, and a bias of <
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

1SE is not worth worrying about.
 When the data are this good, though, model error (bias) might exceed imprecisio
n.
 This is particularly an issue for inferences near the ends of a study (e.g.,
 about very recent abundance) since there is less data of direct relevance
 to the recent past (i.e., IMR or CKMR recaptures of recently-born cohorts).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "high-level manager" solution is "just" to make a more sophisticated
 model, e.g., with time-varying demographic parameters.
 Time-varying RoI (modelled as a random walk) has actually been tried in
 a couple of CKMR applications (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Hillary2018WS-CKMR"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "trenkel2022thornbaCKMR"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), but in neither case was there enough signal in the data for it to make
 any difference.
 The MLE of the random walk variance came out at 0, and the inferences were
 basically the same as if a fixed RoI had been used— but that does not mean
 that the dynamics really were steady-state, just that the converse could
 not be conclusively proved.
 In the case of walrus, where the data are qualitatively rich (e.g., on juvenile
 survival and calf production) as well as quantitatively generous, it would
 probably make more sense to move to a demographically-explicit age-structured
 model parametrized in terms of calf survival rather than RoI (i.e., with
 RoI being an emergent property), and to allow survival and\SpecialChar breakableslash
or breeding rates
 to vary in some manner such as random walks.
 Exploring such a model would be an interesting challenge, but it is probably
 sensible to wait until the data actually arrives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Grandparent-Grandchild Pairs (GGPs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HSPs are genetically indistinguishable from GGPs.
 This creates a difficulty in some CKMR applications, because demographically
 HSPs and GGPs are both "common" when considered over long-enough timescales,
 but they have very different probabilities conditional on individual covariates.
 Thus, interpreting actual GGPs as if they were HSPs would lead to biased
 parameter estimates: not just because the number of kin-pairs would be
 artificially inflated, but more seriously because e.g., the birth-gap between
 GGPs is typically much longer than between HSPs, so that survival estimates
 (based on declining HSP frequency as birth-gap increases) would be distorted.
 However, the problem sometimes carries the seeds of its own resolution.
 Birth-dates of a GGP must be separated by at least twice the age-of-maturity,
 and usually by rather more than that; thus, by constraining the comparisons
 which get included in the model to those which are 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 unlikely to include GGPs based on birth gap, unbiased estimates can be
 achieved usually with little cost in reduced sample size (we are not making
 use of any HSPs that are separated by a long gap, but there won't be many
 of those anyway).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That approach is the simplest, and the one we have followed here, taking
 a 16-year maximum gap as pretty safe GGP-wise.
 It works well for species with high-ish age-at-maturity, and when there
 is not much uncertainty about individual age (which we expect for walrus).
 The alternative, more complicated, approach is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
specifically develop CKMR probability formulae for GGPs as well as for HSPs,
 conditional on the same covariates;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
add
\emph default
 the two probabilities, at each covariate combination, to get the probabiliity
 that "this pair will genetically look like an HSP or GGP" (valid since
 those kinships are mutually exclusive).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In principle, this is statistically optimal because it avoids having to
 discard any comparisons.
 And step 1 is not really any 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 difficult than any other aspect of CKMR.
 However, it does all entail substantial extra work, especially when there
 is a non-annual breeding cycle.
 Since relatively few potential comparisons are going to cover a birth-gap
 of >16 years while still having the first birth post-2000, we feel that
 truncate-and-ignore is a justifiable treatment for walrus GGPs, at least
 during design.
 When the real data arrives, the model could perhaps be expanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that FTPs ("Full-Thiatic Pairs" e.g., uncle-niece) are also genetically
 indistinguishable from HSPs and GGPs.
 However, they are rare in long-lived species that do not tend to repeat-mate
 with the same partner, because an FTP already implies the existence of
 a FSP in the previous generation, and FSPs require a repeat-mating.
 In a species like walrus, the great majority of sibs are half- rather than
 full-sibs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lethal samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A big part of the original appeal of CKMR was that it could be done even
 if samples came only from dead animals— unlike conventional IMR.
 This opened up a vast field of applications, especially in fisheries but
 also for hunted species.
 In particular, lethal samples are often available "for free" (perhaps through
 legal reporting requirements) from the hunters\SpecialChar breakableslash
fishers.
 This can reduce or even eliminate the need for expensive surveys (which,
 at least in fisheries, are often outright impossible anyway).
 The bearded seal studies of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Taras, Conn 
\emph on
et al.

\emph default
 (in prep) use lethal samples only, and that may be enough for future monitoring
 of that species (which is harvested more intensely than walrus are, so
 that lethal samples may be enough).
 Since there is a substantial ongoing hunt for Pacific walrus, and mechanisms
 have been in place for some years to collect and store samples, it is obviously
 worth investigating what extra information those walrus lethal samples
 could provide in a CKMR setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That should be a reasonably straightforward exercise in future, now that
 the main walrus CKMR model and design framework is in place.
 CK probability formulae for lethal samples are similar to the non-lethal
 formulae, but usually a bit simpler becaue there is no need to include
 "forward survival probabilities" (i.e., that a sampled animal may, at some
 future date after sampling, give birth to another sampled animal).
 The flipside of this simplicity is that lethal samples do not give any
 direct information on juvenile survival
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Juvenile survival (at least, cumulative survival from birth til maturity)
 can sometimes be inferred indirectly based on directly estimating all other
 parameters in a Leslie matrix, including RoI.
 Note that adult survival can be estimated from CKMR alone using half-sibs
 (so, just with lethal samples alone if necessary), at least as an average
 across ages.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and of course they cannot be used for IMR.
 However, it is entirely possible to use both lethal and non-lethal samples
 within the same model, they are just different "types" of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Age composition data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Age composition data are crucial to most fish stock assessments, whether
 obtained directly from e.g., otolith readings, or indirectly and implicitly
 via length composition data.
 Mostly, such data come from catches, and are therefore likely to be subject
 to selectivity biases (i.e., not to be representative of the population's
 composition); a lot of fisheries modeling effort goes into dealing with
 selectivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Individual
\emph default
 age data, or some surrogate, are basically essential for CKMR, because
 they are used in conditioning the probability formulas.
 However, age 
\emph on
composition
\emph default
 data (regardless of kinship) are not essential, at least not for classically
 mammalesque species— i.e., where all adults are basically the same in "samplabili
ty" and fecundity, or at least where there is not likely to be much systematic
 age effect on those parameters.
 Nevertheless, age composition data are potentially informative about detailed
 population dynamics, especially if the composition starts changing over
 time.
 It then becomes possible to infer changes in, say, breeding rates or age-specif
ic survival rates, thus decomposing the catch-all "RoI" into its drivers,
 and improving predictive (and reactive) power.
 Selectivity still needs to be grappled with, since e.g., juveniles and adults
 are likely to have different per capita sampling probabilities, and that
 weakens the effective information content to some extent.
 In general, models using explicit age composition data require a lot more
 parameters.
 A full age-structured population dynamics model for walrus would entail
 modeling decisions (and parameters) to deal with the "initial" population
 age composition (in 2000, say).
 On the other hand, once the rather formidable age-structured machinery
 has been set up, there may be fewer awkward decisions to take in other
 aspects, e.g., about approximating the information from self-recaptures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main benefit of age compositions for mammalesque CKMR modeling (particularly
 for medium-term predictions) would probably be for juveniles, although
 it is in this part of life that selectivity is most annoying (i.e., strongest
 links to age).
 The population age composition of 
\emph on
adults
\emph default
 is not particularly useful for mammalesque CKMR, at least in "bottom line"
 terms of estimating absolute abundance and recent trend, although it can
 be informative about long-term.
 In this study, we chose to ignore the future availability of age composition
 data, in favour of simplifying the modeling to "stage-structured dynamics",
 with a lot fewer parameters to estimate— although the need to handle self-recap
ture data (which does not feature in other CKMR designs that we have seen)
 undoes some of that simplification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see two main options for CKMR-driven walrus models:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
block-structured, no use of age 
\emph on
composition
\emph default
 data, some fudging of individual MR data, few parameters, mostly simpler
 code;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
full age-structured, include composition data but also model (time-varying?)
 selectivity, more parameters, 
\emph on
possibly
\emph default
 more inferential power, substantially more code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best modeling choice for walrus is not obvious.
 For design purposes, the first (simpler) option seems better, even with
 hindsight, but when the real data arrive, it may be preferable to explore
 a full-age-based model as well.
 It is certainly possible to incorporate (non-selective) age composition
 data into CKMR models and designs—we have done so for fish—but it would
 require re-engineering the walrus model to go full-age-based.
 As long as the marginal cost of ageing individual samples (marginal, given
 that their DNA is already being extracted for CKMR) is low enough to afford
 ageing the entire sample set (or at least non-calves), then it might be
 simplest to wait until the age data arrive, then see how things look before
 deciding on changes.
 If there are difficult cost decisions to take beforehand, about whether
 to age only a portion of the dataset— e.g., how many? which ones? specifically
 target ones in kin-pairs?— then it is in principle possible to investigate
 the cost-benefits of these options.
 However, since that would require major re-modeling, it is not to be undertaken
 lightly.

During model development, we discussed whether it would be useful to also
 have field measurements of whether a female was accompanied by a non-calf
 juvenile (presumably her previous offspring).
 The indication was that it 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be possible to record such information, although reliability might be dubious
 and all additional data requirements do carry some impost in a hectic field-sam
pling context.
 At that time, we were still expecting to develop a spatial Hidden-Markov
 Model.
 Spatially speaking, it does become slightly useful to know whether a sampled
 female adult is still accompanied or not, because if she is then it reduces
 the subsequent number of years in which she and that offspring might move
 independently, and thus affects the conditional probability of kinship
 given subsequent locations-of-sampling.
 However, in a non-spatial setting, there is actually nothing to be gained
 from having this information.
 From current datasheets, we will already know whether a sampled female
 adult (whose age we will know) is accompanied by a calf; this does convey
 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 extra statistical information, as discussed, because it informs on her
 current state in the breeding cycle.
 If she is not accompanied by a calf, though, all we know is that she is
 not in "breeding state 2", whether or not she is accompanied by a previous
 offspring.
 The non-calf accompaniment status therefore adds no information, and for
 CKMR purposes is not worth making the effort (although there might be other
 reasons to pursue it).

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code for this project embodies a full-featured ICKMR model that could
 likely be applied with few or no modifications to real walrus data—provided
 that DNAge error indeed proves to be ignorable for this species.
 The precision of estimated parameters (for females) should be very good
 by 2027, and possibly before that given the past sample sizes.
 There is the opportunity to explore tweaks to the sampling scheme, but
 the existing scheme seems likely to be so effective that there may not
 be much point.
 When enough real data arrive, it 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be worth considering a move to an explicitly age-structured model that
 also uses calf samples directly, and that includes calf survival as an
 explicit parameter.
 At that same time, it 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 also be worth considering models with time-varying parameters, since the
 period being modelled is quite long (nearly 30 years), the world does not
 stand still, and—crucially—for once the dataset should be powerful enough
 to allow it.
 However, the existing model may be adequate as is; it all depends on the
 management purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CKMR is new enough that most species seem to bring their own wrinkles, and
 walrus have indeed turned out quite wrinkly.
 The complications of noisy age estimates and spatial fidelity, which we
 expected to be major issues when this project began, now seem less likely,
 and probably ignorable at least until the data arrive to check them.
 However, the addition of self-recapture data (IMR)— which looks simple
 in principle for ICKMR— has turned out more complicated than we anticipated,
 because the very simple population dynamics model that usually works well
 for mammalesque CKMR does not fit IMR equally well.
 Nevertheless, we do now have a reasonable joint ICKMR model, and it is
 interesting to see how much additional inferential power is brought by
 the CKMR data— data which is effectively "free", in terms of marginal cost
 on top of existing sampling.
 The answer is: a lot.
 Depending on what one is trying to estimate, precision is two to three
 times higher with CKMR data than without it.
 For walrus, CKMR is worth the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This design project has, by intention, the comparative "luxury" of being
 able to test the estimation code against an individual-based simulation
 framework that was written completely separately.
 Although both modellers are trying to embody the same biology and sampling,
 there was no collusion about the code for the two parts, and indeed the
 programs for individual-forward-simulation and for aggregate-backward-estimatio
n in CKMR look 
\emph on
completely
\emph default
 different.
 This is a very valuable exercise.
 At the time of writing (after only the very first attempt at testing),
 there is a fairly small but significant difference between the two, which
 still has to be sorted out.
 There are several places on either side where minor bugs or "discrepancies
 of interpretation" might have crept in.
 At any rate, the differences are fairly small in the scheme of things,
 and we do not think they substantially weaken our general conclusions about
 expected precision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of code, the existing model should to be fully translated into
 TMB before application to real data (though in fact the walrus model is
 simple enough that an R-only version might work— for many species, that
 is not the case).
 In fact, we have already translated an early version of the R code, but
 it will need revision.
 Since this project began, there have been some improvements in the TMB
 toolkit which should make the process less gruesome; the substantive parts
 of the code can be made to look very similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways the existing model might be improved.
 One is to consider the use of calf samples (which we have ignored to date);
 that will entail consideration of how they affect precision, and to what
 extent they are a useful the quantitative value.
 Another is to incorporate lethal samples from hunts.
 For the longer-term, it is possible that extensive hunt samples might contribut
e enough precision to allow a less-intense direct-sampling program, while
 still maintainineg adequate precision for management.

When using Calf\SpecialChar breakableslash
No-calf status for adult females in MOP probs, we need the
 probability that the future (or past) breeding state will be 2, given state
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 at sampling in year 0.
 Future is simpler:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\mathbb{P}\left[B_{+t}=2|B_{0}=b,\text{survives from \ensuremath{0} to \ensuremath{t}},t>0\right]\nonumber \\
=\sum_{b^{*}}\mathbb{P}\left[B_{+t-1}=b^{*}|B_{0}=b,\cdots\right]\times\mathbb{P}\left[B_{+1}=2|B_{0}=b\right]\label{eq:fwd-cond-breed}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sets up a recursion, starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[B_{0}=2|B_{0}=b\right]=\mathbf{I}\left(b=2\right)$
\end_inset

 at time 0.
 The second term is direct from the breeding matrix.
 Failure-to-survive (which is assumed independent of breeding status) is
 handled elsewhere in the "forward POP probability" ***.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of "past", we also need to condition on age-at-sampling 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, since we know the female was in state 3 at age 5.
 In this case, "retrospective survival" is automatic (you can't reach age
 7 unless you survived being 6...).
 However, if the female would have been below age 7 at year 
\begin_inset Formula $-t$
\end_inset

, then she could not have been in state 2 then, so the overall probability
 would be 0.
 Bayes' theorem is required; for brevity, we drop the obvious explicit condition
s after the first line.
 Curly braces around a conditioning term indicate that the term in question
 is irrelevant given the other conditionals (e.g., because of a Markov property
 in time).
